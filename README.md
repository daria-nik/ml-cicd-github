# ML CI/CD Project

This project demonstrates a minimal reproducible ML pipeline
used for CI/CD verification with GitHub Actions.

It includes:
- simple training script on the Breast Cancer dataset
- preprocessing module
- model definition
- unit tests
- CI configuration files

Deepchecks, EvidentlyAI and MLflow runs are executed in Colab
and included in the final PDF report (not stored in the repository).
